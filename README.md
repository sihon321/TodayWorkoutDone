# Project Title: TodayworkoutDone

## Description
TodayworkoutDone is an iOS application designed to help users track their daily workouts, create personalized routines, and monitor their fitness progress. It seamlessly integrates with HealthKit to provide a holistic view of the user's health data.

## Features
- **Workout Tracking:** Log various types of workouts, including strength, cardio, pilates, stretching, and yoga.
- **Customizable Routines:** Create, save, and manage personalized workout routines.
- **HealthKit Integration:** Synchronize workout data with Apple HealthKit to contribute to activity rings and overall health metrics.
- **Calendar View:** Visualize past and planned workouts on a calendar, making it easy to track consistency.
- **Progress Monitoring:** (Implicitly through calendar and workout history) Users can review their completed workouts.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** A clean, intuitive interface built with SwiftUI for a smooth user experience.
- **Data Persistence:** Utilizes Core Data to store user workout data and routines locally on the device.
- **Categorized Workouts:** Workouts are organized by categories for easy browsing and selection.

## Technologies Used
- **Swift:** The primary programming language for iOS development.
- **SwiftUI:** Apple's modern declarative framework for building user interfaces across Apple platforms.
- **Core Data:** Used for local data persistence of workout routines, workout history, and user data.
- **HealthKit:** Integrated for accessing and storing health-related data, such as workout sessions.
- **Combine:** Used for reactive programming and handling asynchronous events, particularly with HealthKit.

## Setup and Installation
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/TodayworkoutDone.git 
    ```
    (Replace `your-username` with the actual username or organization if known, otherwise, this is a general instruction).
2.  **Open in Xcode:** Navigate to the cloned directory and open `TodayworkoutDone.xcodeproj`.
3.  **Select a Target/Simulator:** Choose an appropriate iOS simulator or a connected physical device.
4.  **Build and Run:** Click the "Play" button (Build and then run the current scheme) in Xcode.
    *   Ensure you have a compatible version of Xcode installed.
    *   Dependencies are managed within the Xcode project, no external package manager steps like CocoaPods or Swift Package Manager installations are explicitly mentioned in the file structure, implying they are directly integrated or not used extensively for external libraries beyond what Apple provides.

## Usage
-   Upon launching the app, users are typically greeted with a main view (e.g., HomeView or MainView).
-   **Navigation:** Use the tab bar at the bottom to navigate between different sections of the app:
    -   **Home/Main:** Often displays a summary of recent activities, quick access to start a workout, or an overview.
    -   **Workouts/Routines:** Browse workout categories (e.g., Strength, Cardio), view available exercises, create new custom routines, or select existing routines to perform.
    -   **Calendar:** View a history of completed workouts and potentially schedule future ones.
    -   **Settings/Profile:** (If applicable) Manage app settings, HealthKit permissions, user profile, etc.
-   **Starting a Workout:**
    1.  Navigate to the workout or routines section.
    2.  Select a predefined workout or a custom routine.
    3.  Follow the on-screen instructions to log sets, reps, duration, etc.
    4.  Save the workout upon completion. Data will be saved locally and, if permissions are granted, to HealthKit.
-   **Creating a Routine:** Users can typically find an "Add Routine" or similar button to create a new workout plan, selecting exercises, and specifying their parameters.
